        "Impurities in ice cores originate from the atmosphere and are deposited with snowfall. They can be grouped into two broad types:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Aerosol-derived particles (solids)**  \n",
        "  - Dust and minerals transported from continental deserts.  \n",
        "  - Sea-salt particles (mainly Na⁺ and Cl⁻) from marine spray.  \n",
        "  - Sulfate and nitrate salts from volcanic eruptions or anthropogenic sources.  \n",
        "  - Soot or black carbon, and occasionally organic material.  \n",
        "\n",
        " **Soluble chemical species (liquids/acidic or basic ions)**  \n",
        "   - Sulfate (SO₄²⁻), nitrate (NO₃⁻), chloride (Cl⁻),  \n",
        "   - Ammonium (NH₄⁺), sodium (Na⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), and others.  \n",
        "   Once incorporated into the firn and ice, these ions remain trapped in the solid matrix or along grain boundaries and inclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impurities can be measured in discrete samples or continuously through the so-called **Continuous Flow Analysis (CFA)**. After ice cores are drilled they are cut into pieces which are dedicated to different types of analysis. A central piece from the interior of the ice core is usually used for the CFA to avoid contamination with materials that have touched the ice core surface. This ice stick is then melted contunuously on a warm plate and the meltwater stream is analysed in real time for multiple ions and acids (Na⁺, Ca²⁺, NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻, etc.). This allows high-resolution (mm-scale) impurity profiles that reflect seasonal or sub-seasonal variations in atmospheric composition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another method that can be indicative of impurities is to measure the electrical conductivity. Because pure ice is an electrical insulator, most of the current actually travels along thin films of acidic liquid at the boundaries between ice crystals. The **Electrical Conductivity Measurement (ECM)** has the advantage of being non-destructive. Thereby a pair of electrodes is dragged along the ice core and the electrical conductivity is measured as a function of depth. The conductivity is increased when acidic impurities (such as H₂SO₄, HNO₃, HCl) are present because they lower the pH. Strong peaks in ECM are often related to sulfur acid deposited during volcanic eruptions. Dust and sea-salt particles often contain neutral or basic impurities (Ca²⁺, Na⁺, NH₄⁺) and have the potential to neutralize acids and decrease the conductivity of the ice.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impurity records serve two key purposes in ice-core science:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) **Establishing timescales & ice-core synchronization**: Because the atmospheric concentration of impurities varies with seasonality, they can be used to establish ice-core timescales through annual-layer counting in the upper parts of ice cores. Volcanic sulfate spikes provide absolute age markers when matched to known eruptions. Distinctive volcanic signals or abrupt impurity events (e.g., large dust peaks) appear across multiple cores and can be used to align timescales between sites.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) **Reconstructing past environments and climate changes**: Many impurities are linked to distinct atmospheric and climatic conditions, and can therefore be used to reconstruct the past climate. For example:  \n",
        "  - Dust and calcium (Ca²⁺) indicate atmospheric dustiness and source aridity.  \n",
        "  - Sodium (Na⁺) and cloride (Cl⁻) trace sea-ice extent and marine influence.  \n",
        "  - Ammonium (NH₄⁺) relates to continental biogenic emissions.  \n",
        "  - Sulfate (SO$_4$²⁻) reflects volcanic emissions.\n",
        "  - Nitrate (NO$_3$⁻) is caused by lightning and natural biomass burning.\n",

        "In the previous exercise, you explored how the concentration of impurities and the oxygen isotope ratio in ice vary with depth, reflecting changes in climatic conditions on both seasonal and longer timescales. The oxygen isotope ratio (δ$^{18}$O) is one of the most powerful proxies used to reconstruct past temperatures and understand large-scale climate variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Oxygen atoms occur in different stable isotopic forms, mainly $^{16}$O and $^{18}$O. The lighter isotope ($^{16}$O) is by far the most abundant, but a small fraction of oxygen atoms are the heavier $^{18}$O isotope. Because the mass of $^{18}$O is greater, molecules of H₂$^{18}$O behave slightly differently from H₂$^{16}$O during phase changes such as evaporation and condensation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most water vapour in the atmosphere originates from ocean evaporation. During this process, molecules containing the lighter $^{16}$O isotope evaporate more easily, leaving the ocean slightly enriched in $^{18}$O. As moist air cools and condenses into precipitation, the opposite happens: heavier $^{18}$O molecules condense and precipitate more readily, so the remaining vapour becomes increasingly depleted in $^{18}$O.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process of fractionation depends strongly on temperature. The colder the air mass becomes as it moves poleward and upward, the more depleted its vapour (and therefore the precipitation) becomes in $^{18}$O. As a result, the ratio between $^{18}$O and $^{16}$O in deposited snow becomes more negative compared to the isotope ratio of the ocean. Since the ratio between $^{18}$O and $^{16}$O is very small, measurements are usually made in terms of the δ-values.

        "*Note*: In reality, $\\alpha$ varies over time and there are a few more parameters that affect the $\\delta ^{18}$O (i.e. $\\Theta \\neq 0$). Such effects can include for example the temperature at the water vapour source region, strength of evaporation recharge, source region location, seasonal timing of accumulation, warm weather bias (e.g. more snow falls in warmer air), cloud properties, cyclone characteristics, or post-depositional alteration. As a result, temperature reconstructions from $\\delta ^{18}$O are more complex than in this simplified exercise.\n"
